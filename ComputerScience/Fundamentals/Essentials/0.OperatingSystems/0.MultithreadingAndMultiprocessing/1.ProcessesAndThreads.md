### Process and Thread
- A process is a self-contained unit of execution that includes everything necessary to complete its tasks
	+ They serve as containers for worker's threads, hared resources, and parameters necessary for completing tasks
	+ Every process must have at least one thread.
- A thread of execution is a sequence of instructions within a process that can be scheduled and run independently.
	+ They can operate concurrently or in parallel with one another.

### Concurrency and Parallelism
- Concurrency, which involves switching between tasks to give the appearance of simultaneous progress;
	+ Concurrent tasks that compete only for the executor's time and don't require a lot of resources can run concurrently within the same thread.
- Parallelism, where tasks genuinely occur at the same time, utilizing multiple resources.
-  Both concepts aim to optimize the execution time and resource utilization in multitasking environments, but they achieve this in different ways:
	+ Concurrency is about dealing with many tasks through quick switching
	+ Parallelism is about doing many tasks exactly at the same time.

### Internal or lightweight concurrency
- Concurrent tasks that compete only for the executor's time and don't require a lot of resources can run concurrently within the same thread. This is more resource-efficient than creating new threads for each task.
- Execution within threads can be synchronous or asynchronous but never parallel.
