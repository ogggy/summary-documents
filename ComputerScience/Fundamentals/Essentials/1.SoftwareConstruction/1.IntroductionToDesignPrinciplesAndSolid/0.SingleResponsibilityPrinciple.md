### Single Responsibility Principle
- The program consists of some programming units like modules, classes, and functions. The ```Single Responsibility Principle``` requires your programming unit to have only one reason to change (i.e. a single responsibility). If you, as a developer, change the menu of a program, it should not affect the way other parts of the program work.

### God object
- A God object is an object that knows too much or does too much.
```
Imagine we're working on a new application for smartphones. It has such functions as an alarm clock, reminders, and stopwatch. Because they are all related to time, they can be united in one class.

When we add the possibility to choose a ringtone for the alarm clock, can we use this for the stopwatch too? And if we add the possibility to save the top 5 results from the stopwatch, how can we use this function for the reminders? In trying to gather similar functions together we instead create a God object.

---> It's better to isolate these three functions from each other, so we can update them independently without polluting the code with unnecessary details. Each part will be responsible for a specific thing and won't know about what the others are doing. This design is more likely to keep the code clean and clear. Let's take a look at how we can organize it even better.
```

### Responsibility boundaries
- The core of the principle is not about breaking the code into small isolated pieces. You gather what belongs to the same responsibility in one place, and then separate units with different responsibilities from each other.
