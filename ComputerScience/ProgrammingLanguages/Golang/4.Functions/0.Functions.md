### Functions
- Functions are blocks of code that take zero or more inputs, process these inputs, and produce zero or more outputs
- Functions help us **divide** our program into small or medium-sized reusable pieces of code, thus improving **readability** and **maintainability** and reducing the complexity of program.
### Basic syntax
- In Go, a function's signature has the following structure:
    + It starts with the keyword ```func```, followed by the name of the function;
    + Then we have a set of parentheses ```(...)``` known as the **parameter list** — it holds zero or more parameters used to import variables into the function;
    + After the parameter list, we have the **return type** of the function — it can be of a single type, of various types, or be empty as well;
    + At the end of the function declaration, we have the code block of the function enclosed in curly brackets ``{}``.
```go
func hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name + "!"
}
```
### Calling a function and passing arguments
- Example: 2 different ways we can call the ```hello()``` function within our ```main``` function and pass a string value as an argument to the message parameter:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func hello(message string) string {
    return "Hello, " + message
}

func main() {
    // Option #1 - Assign the return value of a function call to a variable.
    // Here we assign to greeting the return value of the hello() function call:
    greeting := hello("I was called via Option #1!")

    // Call the greeting variable within the Println function:
    fmt.Println(greeting) // Hello, I was called via Option #1!
    
    // Option #2 - Call the hello function with a string value directly within the Println function:
    fmt.Println(hello("I was called via Option #2!")) // Hello, I was called via Option #2!
}
```
- In option #1, we assign the return value of the ```hello()``` function call to the ```greeting``` variable.
- In option #2, we take a more direct approach. We call the ```hello()``` function directly within the ```fmt.Println()``` function with the string value ```"I was called via Option #2!"```

### Passing arguments by pointers
- Go allows us to pass arguments to our function by values or pointers; passing arguments by pointers is also known as **passing by reference**.
- In contrast to **passing by value**, which makes a copy of the **data** we are passing to the function, **passing by reference** makes a copy of the **pointer** but not of the data it points to.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func realSwap(x *int, y *int) {
    // directly exchange the value stored at address x (42) 
    // with the value stored at address y (27)
    *x, *y = *y, *x
}

func main() {
    var num1 = 42
    var num2 = 27

    fmt.Println("Before swapping values: x =", num1, "and y =", num2)
    realSwap(&num1, &num2) // pass the address of num1 and num2 to realSwap
    fmt.Println("After swapping values: x =", num1, "and y =", num2)
}

// Output:
// Before swapping values: x = 42 and y = 27
// After swapping values: x = 27 and y = 42
```

```go
func fakeSwap(x int, y int) { // fakeSwap takes two integer types as arguments
    x, y = y, x
}
fmt.Println("Before swapping values: x = ", num1, "and y =", num2)
fakeSwap(num1, num2) // pass integer values num1 and num2 to fakeSwap
fmt.Println("After swapping values: x = ", num1, "and y =", num2)

// Output:
// Before swapping values: x = 42 and y = 27
// After swapping values: x = 42 and y = 27
```
---> ```fakeSwap()``` receives and manipulates a private copy of the two integers we passed to it and stores them in ```different``` memory locations. Therefore, any changes made inside ```fakeSwap()``` are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller. ```realSwap()``` passes to it the pointers ```*x``` and ```*y```, the values of ```num1``` and ```num2``` are properly exchanged.
