### Maps
- Maps are a handy tool that helps us store and efficiently access objects. Golang maps, in particular, behave similarly to a data structure known as a hash table.
- In Go, maps are a convenient built-in data structure that associates elements of one type, known as keys, with elements of the same or another type, known as values.
- Keys and values can be of **any** type, such as integers, floating or complex numbers, strings, pointers, etc, as long as we can compare these types using the ```== ```and ```!=``` operators.
- All keys are **unique**
- A basic map declaration:
```go
var ranks map[string]string
```

### Initializing a map
- We can only add items after initializing the map.
- If we tried to add an item to the uninitialized ranks map, a run-time panic would occur:
```go
var ranks map[string]string
ranks["gold"] = "ðŸ¥‡" // Trying to add key: "gold" and value "ðŸ¥‡"

// Output: panic: assignment to entry in nil map
```
- To avoid the run-time panic, we can initialize maps in various ways via the make function from Go's builtin package:
```go
var ranks map[string]string // This only declares the 'ranks' map variable
ranks = make(map[string]string) // Option #1 to initialize the previously declared 'ranks' map

var ranks = make(map[string]string) // Option #2 to declare & initialize the 'ranks' map

ranks := make(map[string]string) // Option #3 to assign, declare & initialize the 'ranks' map
```
### Adding items to a map
```go
ranks["gold"] = "ðŸ¥‡"
ranks["silver"] = "ðŸ¥ˆ"
ranks["bronze"] = "ðŸ¥‰"

fmt.Println(ranks) // map[bronze:ðŸ¥‰ gold:ðŸ¥‡ silver:ðŸ¥ˆ]
```
- Since we've previously assigned the ```ranks``` map keys and values as a ```string```, we can only pass string-type items to it.
-  We can use a map literal to both declare and create it:
```go
elements := map[string]string{
    "H": "Hydrogen",
    "He": "Helium",
    "Li": "Lithium",
}

fmt.Println(elements) // map[H:Hydrogen He:Helium Li:Lithium]
```

### Working with items on a map
- To retrieve a value from a key:
```go
helium := elements["He"]
fmt.Println(helium) // Helium
```
- If we try to retrieve a value from a non-existing key, we will retrieve the **default** value for the type:
```go
sodium := elements["Na"]
fmt.Println(sodium) // Prints an empty string - the default value of the string type
```
- It is also important to know that we can read values from an uninitialized or a nil map!
```go
var numbers map[int]int
fmt.Println(numbers) // map[] <- means that the map is uninitialized

fmt.Println(numbers[2]) // 0 <- no panic output, we just get the default value: 0 for integers

fmt.Println(numbers == nil) // true <- confirms that the map is 'nil'
```
- We can check if a specific key exists within a map using the following syntax:
```go
val, ok := map[key]
```
- The above syntax will return a ```boolean``` value within the ```ok``` variable. If the ```key``` and its ```value``` are present, then the ```value``` will be returned within the ```val``` variable:
```go
func main() {
    ...
    key := "He"
    if val, ok := elements[key]; ok {
        fmt.Println("The element", key, "is", val)
        return
        // Output:
        // The element He is Helium
    }
    fmt.Println("The element", key, "is not in the map")
}
```
- We can update the value of a key in our map with the following syntax:
```go
elements["He"] = "ðŸ˜ˆ HellBoy ðŸ˜ˆ"
fmt.Println(elements) // map[He:ðŸ˜ˆ HellBoy ðŸ˜ˆ Li:Lithium]
```
