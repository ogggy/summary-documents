### Slice expressions
- Go provides the ability to access individual elements of arrays and slices by using indices. It is possible because these types are considered ordered sequences.
- Construct a subslice
```go
s[low:high]
```
- The range indexes ```low``` and ```high``` select which elements of the s slice will appear in the result
```go
s := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11} // len: 5 cap: 5
s1 := s[1:3]
fmt.Println(s1) // [3 5]
```
- The slice element ```s[1] = 3``` at range index ```low``` is included within the new subslice s1, the element ```s[3] = 7``` at range index ```high``` is not included. In simple terms, ```high``` serves as a range boundary for slice elements.
- The newly created subslice ```s1``` has the length ```len``` equal to the indexes range ```high-low -> 3-1 = 2``` and capacity cap equal to ```cap(s)-low -> 5-1 = 4```:
```go
fmt.Println("len:", len(s1), "cap:", cap(s1)) // len: 2 cap: 4
```
### Details of simple slice expressions
- When writing a simple slice expression to get a subslice from an ```array``` or a ```string```, the low and high indexes are valid if they are in range: ```0 <= low <= high <= len(s)```, otherwise, they are out of range, and you'll get a runtime error.
```go
star := "Polaris"
fmt.Println(star[-1])  // invalid argument: index -1
fmt.Println(star[0:8]) // runtime error: slice bounds out of range [:8] with length 7
```
- When getting a subslice from a slice, the resulting subslice capacity cap is equal to the base slice's capacity minus the low index (i.e., cap(s)-low), rather than the base slice's length len:
```go
teams := []string{"Bayern Munich", "Real Madrid", "Manchester City"}
t := teams[1:2]
fmt.Println(t, "| len:", len(t), "cap:", cap(t)) // [Real Madrid] | len: 1 cap: 2
fmt.Println(t[1:3]) // runtime error: slice bounds out of range [:3] with capacity 2
```
- Simple slice expressions support arrays, slices, strings, and pointers to array/slice as well:
```go
consts := new([3]float64)
*consts = [3]float64{3.1416, 2.718, 1.618} // pointer to an array
fmt.Println(consts[1:3])                   // [2.718 1.618]

animals := new([]string)
*animals = []string{"cat", "dog", "fish"} // pointer to a slice
fmt.Println((*animals)[1:3])              // ["dog" "fish"]
```
---> When slicing a pointer to an array, we can simply use the regular s[low:high] syntax. However, when slicing a pointer to a slice, we need to use the ```(*s)[low:high]``` syntax.

- If we try to get the subslice of a nil slice, the result will also be a nil slice:
```go
var n []int       // nil slice
fmt.Println(n[:]) // []
```
### Getting the subslice of a subslice
- Subslices ```share``` a common underlying array with their "parent slice". 
```go
var nums [5]int
nums = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
n1 := nums[0:4] // underlying array of n1 is array nums, n1[2] == nums[2]
n2 := n1[0:3]   // underlying array of n2 is array n1, n2[2] == n1[2]
n2[2] = 343     // n2[2] == n1[2] == nums[2], refer to the same underlying array element
```

### Full slice expressions
- The key difference between simple slice expressions and full slice expressions is that the latter has one additional range index max:
``` js
s[low:high:max]
```
- The above syntax constructs a subslice of the same type and with the same length as the simple slice expression ```s[low:high]```. Essentially, the ```max``` index allows you to control the **maximum capacity** of the resulting subslice.
- The resulting subslice ```len``` is equal to ```high-low```, however, the ```capacity``` cap is equal to ```max-low -> 4-1 = 3```.

### Details of full slice expressions
- The index range for full slice expressions is different from simple slice expressions. The indexes are valid if they are in range: ```0 <= low <= high <= max <= cap(s)```, otherwise, they are out of range:
```go
s := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
fmt.Println(s[1:3:2]) // invalid slice indices: 2 < 3
fmt.Println(s[1:3:6]) // runtime error: slice bounds out of range [::6] with capacity 5
```
- In full slice expressions, only the low index is optional; it defaults to zero in case we omit it:
```go
fmt.Println(s[:3:5]) // [2 3 5]
```
- In turn, omitting the high or max index isn't allowed:
```go
fmt.Println(s[1::5]) // middle index required in 3-index slice
fmt.Println(s[1:3:]) // final index required in 3-index slice 
```
