### Slices
- A slice declaration looks like an array declaration but without specifying the size
- The core difference between an array and a slice is that an array holds the data, whereas a slice holds a pointer to the array that holds the data. 
- Just like with a pointer, the default value for a slice is nil

```go     
    var s []int // Declared, but not initialized slice of integers;
            // s is equal to nil

	s[0] = 10   // Panic: index out of range [0] with length 0 
```
- While the new function only takes the object type as its argument, the make function takes a length expression as the second argument and a capacity variable as the third argument 
- The make function returns a slice, not a pointer to a slice, since a slice is already a reference to the underlying array.

	Underlying array `[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]`

	Slice			 `[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]`
 
- An array and a slice are somewhat like a variable and a pointer, correspondingly:
	+ Both a slice and a pointer require initialization through a special built-in function;
	+ Both have nil as the default value;
	+ Both contain not the data itself but a reference to it.

### Slice assignment
```go 
	var s = []int{12, 23, 34}
	var sn = s

	sn[0] = 0
	sn[1] = 11
	fmt.Println(s)  // [0 11 34]
	fmt.Println(sn) // [0 11 34]
```

--> A slice is a reference to an underlying array. When you declare and assign a new slice with the var sn = s statement, you copy only the **pointer**, not the **actual data**. Thus, **s[i]** and **sn[i]** point to the same element within the same underlying array. 

- On the other hand, if s was an array, the var sn = s statement would result in copying the data from s to sn, as we expected.
```go 
	var s = [3]int{12, 23, 34} // Here we simply specify the size 
							   // to convert the slice into an array
	var sn = s

	sn[0] = 0
	sn[1] = 11

	fmt.Println(s)  // [12 23 34]
	fmt.Println(sn) // [ 0 11 34]
```

- We have a special built-in function used to copy slices â€“ the copy function. Its first argument is the destination, and the second one is the source.
- The copy function returns the number of copied elements. It will be the minimum of len(source) and len(destination). Let's have a look at the following example:
```go 
	var s = []int{12, 23, 34}
	var sn = make([]int, len(s))

	var n = copy(sn, s)  // var n is the number of copied elements 

	sn[0] = 0            // Here, we assign a new value to the slice elements in order
	sn[1] = 11           // to see whether it is a proper copy or the same slice

	fmt.Println(n)       // 3
	fmt.Println(s)       // [12 23 34] - the initial slice with no changes
	fmt.Println(sn)      // [ 0 11 34] - the copied slice with modified elements
```
- Slice allocation and reallocation
```go 
	var countries = make([]string, 0, 2000) // len: 0 | cap: 2000
	var countries = make([]string, 2000) // len: 2000 | cap: 2000
```
	
- Append slice to slice
```go
	sl1 = append(sl1, sl2...) // append sl2 to sl1 here!
```
