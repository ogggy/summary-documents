### Method
- A **method** is a function with a defined **receiver** argument. The receiver appears in its argument list between the ```func``` keyword and the method name.
- Since Go doesn't have classes like other Object-Oriented programming languages, methods are usually defined on ```struct``` types; however, we can define them on non-struct types, too!
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type User struct {
    FirstName, LastName, Email string
}

// FormatUserInfo method definition on the 'User' struct type:
func (u User) FormatUserInfo() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s %s email is: %s", u.FirstName, u.LastName, u.Email)
}

func main() {
    spongebob := User{
        FirstName: "SpongeBob",
        LastName:  "SquarePants",
        Email:     "spongebob@krustykrab.bb",
    }

    fmt.Println(spongebob.FormatUserInfo()) // here we call and print the method
}

// Output:
// SpongeBob SquarePants email is: spongebob@krustykrab.bb
```
- The addition of an extra parameter ```(u User)``` after the ```func``` keyword for specifying the **receiver** of the method
- In very simple terms, the receiver is a declaration of the type that we decide to define the method on; in this case, we define it on a ```struct``` type: ```User```.

### Defining methods on non-struct types
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

type SquareSide float64 // 'SquareSide' is a non-struct type!

type CircleRadius float64 // 'CircleRadius' is a non-struct type!

// Area method definition on a non-struct type:
func (s SquareSide) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pow(float64(s), 2)
}

// Area method with the same name on a different type:
func (c CircleRadius) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * math.Pow(float64(c), 2)
}

func main() {
    s := SquareSide(1.219)
    fmt.Printf("Area of square ‚èπÔ∏è: %.3f\n", s.Area())

    c := CircleRadius(2.438)
    fmt.Printf("Area of circle ‚≠ï: %.3f", c.Area())
}

// Output:
// Area of square ‚èπÔ∏è: 1.486
// Area of circle ‚≠ï: 18.673
```
---> We can define methods with the same name on different types. As you can see in the above code, we can define the ```Area()``` method on both ```SquareSide``` and ```CircleRadius``` types. This is one of the key differences between methods and standard Go functions.

### Methods with pointer receivers
- When we create a method with a pointer receiver, all the changes made within it are visible to the caller. This is the key difference between methods with **value receivers** and methods with **pointer receivers**.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Animal struct {
    Name, Emoji string
}

// UpdateEmoji method definition with pointer receiver '*Animal':
func (a *Animal) UpdateEmoji(emoji string) {
    a.Emoji = emoji
}

func main() {
    monkey := Animal{
        Name:  "Monkey",
        Emoji: "üêí",
    }

    fmt.Printf("Monkey's emoji (Before): %s\n", monkey.Emoji)
    monkey.UpdateEmoji("üôâ")
    fmt.Printf("Monkey's emoji (After): %s\n", monkey.Emoji)
}

// Output:
// Monkey's emoji (Before): üêí
// Monkey's emoji (After): üôâ
```
- Since methods often need to modify their receiver, **pointer receivers** are more commonly used than **value receivers**

### Deciding over value or pointer receivers
- There are two valid reasons to use a pointer receiver:
    + The first is so that our method can modify the value that its receiver points to.
    + The second is to avoid copying the value on each method call. This tends to be more efficient if the receiver is a large struct with many fields, for example, a struct that holds a large JSON response.
