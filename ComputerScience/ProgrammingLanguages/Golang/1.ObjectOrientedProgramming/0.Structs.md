### Structs
- A struct, short for structure, is a data type that allows us to group and combine elements of different types such as integers, strings, maps, and even other structs into a single type.
- Any real-world entity that has a series of properties can be represented as a struct.

```go   
type Animal struct {
    Name        string
    Class       string
    Emoji       string
    avgLifespan int
    Domestic    bool
}
```

### Initializing structs
- The most basic struct initialization looks like this:
```go   
var crocodile Animal
```
- Another way to initialize a struct is with the help of the ```new``` function from Go's builtin package:
    + It allocates memory for all the fields of the struct
    + It returns a pointer to the struct (```*Animal```)
    + It sets default values to each struct field
```go
crocodile := new(Animal)
```

### Accessing and initializing individual fields
- We can access its individual fields with the help of the ```.``` operator.
```go
fmt.Println("Animal name:", crocodile.Name)
fmt.Println("Class:", crocodile.Class)
fmt.Println("Emoji representation:", crocodile.Emoji)
fmt.Println("Average lifespan in years:", crocodile.avgLifespan)
fmt.Println("Is this animal domestic?", crocodile.Domestic)

// Output:
// Animal name: Crocodile
// Class: Reptile
// Emoji representation: üêä
// Average lifespan in years: 55
// Is this animal domestic? false
```
- We can also assign values to individual fields of an initialized struct, using the ```.``` operator.
```go
var octopus Animal // declare & initialize a new 'octopus' struct of the 'Animal' type

octopus.Name = "Octopus"
octopus.Class = "Cephalopod"
octopus.Emoji = "üêô"
...
```

### Structs comparison and equality
- Two structs are comparable with the equality ```==``` operator if they belong to the same type and have the same field values

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```go
// Declare and assign three different structs of the 'Person' type
jerry1 := Person{Name: "Jerry", Age: 37}
jerry2 := Person{Name: "Jerry", Age: 37}
jerry3 := Person{Name: "Jerry"} // 'jerry3' is missing initialization for the 'Age' field

fmt.Printf("structs: jerry1 and jerry2 are equal is %t\n", jerry1 == jerry2)
fmt.Printf("structs: jerry1 and jerry3 are equal is %t", jerry1 == jerry3)

// Output:
// structs: jerry1 and jerry2 are equal is true
// structs: jerry1 and jerry3 are equal is false
```
-  Field data types that will make your struct not comparable.
    + Slice
    + Map
    + ...

### Anonymous structs
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var teslaModelS = struct {
    Brand, Model, Color string
    weightInKg          int
}{
    Brand:      "Tesla",
    Model:      "Model S",
    Color:      "Red",
    weightInKg: 2250,
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(teslaModelS) // {Tesla Model S Red 2250}
}
```
- We declare the teslaModelS anonymous struct with three steps. 
    + First, we apply the var ```teslaModelS``` = struct syntax, 
    + Then declare its fields within curly braces ```{}```, 
    + Finally, initialize the fields with a struct literal.
- Anonymous structs provide a quick way to create a struct without actually creating a new data type in our program
-  We want to use a struct only once in our program, we can't accidentally use it again.

### Nested structs
- A struct may contain one or many structs as part of its fields
```go
type Address struct {
    City  string
    State string
}

type Employee struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    Salary  float64
    Address Address // this field is the nested struct Address within Employee
}
```
### Anonymous fields
- It is possible to create a struct with fields that contain only a data type without the field name
```go 
type Country struct {
    string
    int
}
var france Country

// this is how we assign values to the anonymous fields,
// the name of the fields is the same as the data type
france.string = "France"
france.int = 67413000

fmt.Println("Country name:", france.string) // Country name: France
fmt.Println("Population:", france.int)      // Population: 67413000
```
- Even though the two anonymous fields string and int don't have a defined name, they get the same name as their data type, by default.
- ```Warning:``` When we create a struct that has anonymous fields, we can only have one anonymous field per data type!

### Promoted fields
- Promoted fields are fields that belong to an anonymous struct field within a struct. We can access promoted fields as if they belong directly to the struct that holds the anonymous struct field.
```go
type Address struct {
    City, State string
}

type Employee struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    Salary  float64
    Address // now this field doesn't have a name, just the Address struct type
}

func main() {
    var homer Employee
    homer.Name = "Homer"
    homer.Age = 39
    homer.Salary = 724.38
    
    // we can access the promoted fields of the nested struct Address directly:
    homer.City = "Springfield"
    homer.State = "Oregon"

    // we can print the promoted fields City and State directly:
    fmt.Println("City:", homer.City)   // City: Springfield
    fmt.Println("State:", homer.State) // State: Oregon
}
```
### Struct tags
- Go allows us to add struct tags to struct fields. Struct tags are annotations that appear after the type of a field in Go struct declaration.
- The most common use of struct tags is to control JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoding
```json
{
  "userID": "123",
  "isActive": true,
  "lastLogin": "2021-12-08T11:27:32.834056-05:00",
  "userType": 1
}
```
- Then the implementation of the struct tag syntax in the User struct:
```go
type User struct {
                        // this column has the struct tags
    UserID    string    `json:"userID"`
    IsActive  bool      `json:"isActive"`
    LastLogin time.Time `json:"lastLogin"`
    UserType  int       `json:"userType"`
}
```
